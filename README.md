ZapRogue
[A monthly game for February 2011](http://foone.wordpress.com/2011/02/28/february-game-zaprogue/)

I was playing with some sample code from [the Roguelike Wiki](http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)
and built it into a monster-hunting game, since my original ideas failed to work thanks to issues with curses and 256 color support. Oh well.

You move with the numpad (make sure numlock is off!) and you press Z to shoot LASERBEAMS! which fly in the direction you last moved.
Enemies are randomly placed and have random ranges of activation (so sniping them from afar won’t always work). The level should be randomized, but I ran out of time, so it’s static.
